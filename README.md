## ThreadedSockets
[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/6osm6hogjo6jtci9/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ShootingKing-AM/threadedsockets/branch/master)

This module is a modification of Default Amxx Sockets module, implementing option for performing threaded socket operations. This Module also include changes done in Sockets2(Bugsy) and Socket_hz in a threaded mode. This module eliminates looping, hidden looping, entity thinks in plugin as well as in the main thread.

#### Downloads
I am going to provide two Projects for this Module. One is debug project(in DebugProject dir), which will contain some crappy printf's and some other extra comments, and Release project(in root dir), which is clean and contains proper documentation.

And coming to binaries, Windows binary is release build of Release project and linux binary is debug build of Release project.
